2. ``` python Converter.py -f VoxelExample.points ```   Note: Instead of VoxelExample you put your file name
3. Load your minecraft with xaero map mod at least once on your world
4. Go to the minecraft folder where is you installation and check for the folder `XaeroWaypoints`, go to your world name folder
5. You can see 3 folders in which:
   1. in dim%0 you put the generated `waypoints.txt`
   2. in dim%1 you put the generated `waypointsEnd.txt` and change is name to `waypoints.txt`
